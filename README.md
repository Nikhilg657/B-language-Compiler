<h1>B-- Language</h1>
B-- is a toy programming language based on BASIC programming language.
This language is line-based, with one statement on each line. A statement is an instruction to tell the computer to do
something. In B--, each line must start with a unique unsigned integer value between 1 and 9999 called the line
number. These numbers specify the order of the statements and give each statement a unique identifier.
<h1>How it will run </h1>
When the program runs, it will start on the lowest numbered line. Note:
<ol>
<li> Each line has a statement that begins with a keyword after the initial line number (e.g. LET, REM, etc)</li>
<li>Tabs are not permitted in the source code</li>
<li>Each item on the line is separated by at least one space</li>
<li>The last line of the program must be an END and no other line can have an END statement</li>
<li> B-- requires that the ASCII character set be used</li>
<li>Lower-case alphabetic characters are not permitted </li>
  </ol>
